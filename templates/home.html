        <h1>Welcome to AccessFood</h1>
        <p> Did you know that food waste makes up about 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions? In order to adress this
            problem, AccessFood is here to help with providing food to people.
            Most of the waste food from restaurants is thrown away, although still in very good quality. AccessFood
            gives an opportunity for Restaurants to submit their waste food, and for people in need for food to access
            it easily.
